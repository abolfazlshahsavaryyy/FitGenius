I want to write a domain description for my new project
I can write about it like this that we have three type of user (normal user,docker,Club coach)
now I define every think based on users
first normal user: normal user or better to say every user has a profile normal user has many training 
program and each training program has many exercise and each exercise has many like by every users
the relation for exercise and training program is one to many because the exercise has been created by
 admin and each exercise has be for many training program also.
and each user has have many food program(or better name if you have for it) 
and user can do many thinks that is relate to other users

user (club coach) a club coach role is a role that a normal user can by passing the information of coach 
to specific endpoint and accept it by admin they can get the role of coach too
each coach can do any think like that that use can do this mean they can create a training 
program and food program etc ...
but extra feature and relation that it has each coach can has many (traing program coach) with mean 
the training progam that can write for other normal user it has some explentation like price 
,max time to write and some thing else 
user can buy  (traing program coach) and then coach has to write program that dscribe for normal user 
if coach not write the program user can create complaint entitiy with check after complaint that validate
how much its true and if was true this mean time spend of that coach has to write program and 
coach not write that this complaint will be send to coach and coach should pay back the money 
a bill with this description will be send for the coach and coach accept this rule while enter as a role 
coach 
coach can create training progam for user that buy the (traing program coach) and this mean many yo many relation for this 
also coach can add exercise entity but normal user just can add many to many relation of exercise to traing program that 
write for itself 
also coach can create a group and any user that has buy the (traing program coach) even one times can join without any accept 
but other user only by accept coach can join
each group has many message that member of that can send

docker role is another role that is looks like coach this mean validation login and create (food program product) and 
like coach has to be responsible for condiquensis of any thing relation to user also each docker has a group for its self with 
is main group and like that user can message in three
each user after buy any product from coach ot docker can rate them so each product has many rate and this rate is show for every 
other user and the number of avg star is compute for the coach of that product
